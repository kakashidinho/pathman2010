GAMELOFT XTREME PROGRAMMING CONTEST 2010: ROUND 1 GAME
====================================
1. Introduction
----------------------
- This is my game submitted for the contest happening long time ago - "GameLoft xtreme programming contest 2010" - where I finished in third place.
- This game is very similar to the classic Pacman. Though, the characters are in 3D.
- Though around that time, I was still a inexperienced student, and my English was not so good. Thus, the documents included might not be well written. 
- I used OpenGL (no shader) for rendering and SDL_mixer for sounds & music.
- A demo video is available on Youtube: http://youtu.be/FC_X0nAuLxY
2. List of folders
----------------------
- Demo: contains compiled game. Open "Demo\bin\PathMan.exe" to run the game.
- Source Code: contains Visual Studio 2008 solution which consists of multiple projects. Details about each project is included in "techdoc.doc" or "techdoc.pdf". Note: in my game, resources (images, sounds,.v..v.v.) are packed in my custom package files. Hence, beside package files in "Source Code/Resources" folder, I also provide original resource files in "Source Code/Resources/Original" folder.
