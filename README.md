GAMELOFT XTREME PROGRAMMING CONTEST 2010: ROUND 1 GAME
====================================
1. Introduction
----------------------
-This is my game submitted for the contest happening long time ago - "GameLoft xtreme programming contest 2010".
-This game is very similar to the classic Pacman. Though, the characters are in 3D.
-Though around that time, I was still a inexperienced student, and my English was not so good. Thus, the documents included might not be well written. 
2. List of folders
----------------------
-Demo: contains compiled game.
-Source Code: contains Visual Studio 2008 solution which consists of multiple projects. Details about each project is included in "techdoc.doc" or "techdoc.pdf". Note: in my game, resources (images, sounds,.v..v.v.) are packed in my custom package files. Hence, beside package files in "Source Code/Resources" folder, I also provide original resource files in "Source Code/Resources/Original" folder.
